#HTML tags and Elements
   All the elements on an HTML page are just content wrapped inside a tag. \
    Opening tags tell the browser that this is the start of an HTML element. `<>` is used to depict it; for example, the opening tag looks like this: `<p>.`\

    Closing tags tell the bowser where the element ends. They are the same as the opening tag, but it contains `/` before the keyword, e.g., `</p>`.\

###Example of HTML Tag
    ```html
    <p> This is a paragraph </p>
    ```


Some of HTML Elements does not need need closing tag this type of elements is called `Void elements`.
    ```html
    <br>
    ```
