# Creating HTML file

To Create HTML file we append the file with `.html` extension.

The Homepage was the website should be name as `index.html` it is an best practice cause the web servers will by default look for an `index.html` to load the webpage.


# DOCTYPE decalaration

Every HTML page starts with `<!DOCTYPE html>` the purpose of this is to tell the browser what Version of HTML it should use to render.

# HTML elemnent

The `<html>` serve the root of the document

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
</html>
```
lang specifies the language of the text content in that element

# Head element

The `<head>` element includes meta-information and should not contain visible content. Common elements inside the head:
`<meta charset="UTF-8">`: \sets the encoding of characters.
`<title>`: Used to set title for tab in web browser.

# Body element

`<body>` elements holds all the content to be displayed on the web page.

# Opening HTML file in browser

You can find the HTML file in your file system and then double click it. This will open up the file in the default browser your system uses.

# Code

```html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>My First Webpage</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
  </body>
</html>

```
